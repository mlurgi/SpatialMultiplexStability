To use the individual-based simulations framework donwload this folder and run the script 'main.py'.

The configure.py file contains the values of parameters relevant to the model.

You should also download the file web.py from my repository https://github.com/mlurgi/pywebs to take advantage of the library for food web analyses.

Any problems let me know @ miguel.lurgi@swansea.ac.uk

Enjoy!
